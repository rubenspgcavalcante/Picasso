# Contact list (CRUD Example)

This is a more complex example using Picasso. Is a contact list registration using all the ideas of a common CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete).

  - Uses **jQuery** for some events and to find html elements
  - Uses **Underscore** templates for views
  - Uses **Twitter Bootstrap** for HTML structuring and style

As you can see, Picasso is flexible to use with a set of libs used in the most of the current web applications.

In this example we use the power of the Picasso HTML form building, using a JSON as reference, and the one-way-databind 
of a model and the form objects. This example works with Picasso events as well.
