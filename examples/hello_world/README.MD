# Hello World Example

This is a simple example, using the main objects from Picasso (Model, View and Controller), and show how they work 
together. There's no CSS in this example to keep it simple.  
Here you'll see how a controller updates a model, and how a view send user data from input to the controller. 
A simple example of Picasso form building is showed as well.
